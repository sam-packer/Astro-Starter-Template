This makes the buttons softer and rounded. Feel free to
remove this to see what buttons look like by default.
Notice how we have the :not(.btn-ghost). Why?
The navbar uses btn-ghost to have a button, but without the
styling. See what happens if you remove it, you'll notice the
buttons on the navbar look weird.
